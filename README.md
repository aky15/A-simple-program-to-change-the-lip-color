This is a simple demo changing the color of the lips implemented in opencv and dilb.
You can adjust the RGB values and the illumination of the lip regions simply by dragging the track bar.You can also decide how thick the mask overlaps the original region by adjusting the mix ratio.
Feel free to use it.
